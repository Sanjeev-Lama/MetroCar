# MetroCar

## Project Overview

In this project, I delved into Metrocar's customer funnel, similar to renowned ride-sharing platforms like Uber and Lyft. Utilizing SQL for data analysis and Tableau for visualization, I unearthed crucial insights to refine Metrocar's user experience and increase conversion rates. Guided by stakeholders' inquiries, I identified key areas for optimization within the customer journey. My task was to conduct a thorough funnel analysis, presenting actionable recommendations supported by data-driven insights.
